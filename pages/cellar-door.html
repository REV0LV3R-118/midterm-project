        <p>There's an old, corroded door that seems to lead to the cellar. It seems to have a lock on it as well. Out of curiosity, you try the key your grandpa gave you. Miraculously, it pops the lock open, and the cellar is now accessible. But why would Gramps give you a key that worked for this door and not the front door? You step forward, but before you can open the door, you hear a shuffling noise coming from within the cabin, along with some rough grumbling. Is there someone inside, or is it a stray rodent that made its way in somehow? Either way, your hands are beginning to shake and you begin to ponder if this vacation is worth it.  </p>
