        <p>You’ve found the front door! You jiggle the handle, but it's locked. Your Grandpa gave you a key for it before you came here. You put the key in the keyhole, but it simply won't turn! You’re positive that this is the right cabin. Did Gramps change the locks and forget? The old man is getting up there in years, maybe he just gave you the wrong key.  Well, you're already here, might as well see if there’s another way in.  </p>
